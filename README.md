# DogVision
a deep learning model that uses transfer learning to predict the breed of a dog by it's image at 99% accuracy

## 1. Problem
Identifying the breed of dog given an image of dog.

## 2. Data
From Kaggle's Dog breed classification competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data

## 3. Evaluation
Multi Class Log Loss prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image

## 4. Features
* We're dealing with images(unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.
* There are 120 breeds (classes) of dogs
* There are around 10000+ images in training set (labels)
* There are around 10000+ images in test set (without labels 'cause we're predicting them)
